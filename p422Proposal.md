#Assigment: P422 Project Proposal
##Name: Conner Mayfield



For my P422 project I plan to create a scheduler/schedule task manager. 
Our day to day lives are so busy and technology is an asset we sometimes do not utilize to its full capabilities.
A personal scheduler/task manager will help the user keep a good track of what events are coming up and what needs to be completed soon. 
The events and their related information will be come from the server side or backend. 
Finally, the front end will be in Angular and will hopefully have a fully multi-interactive interface. 

Quick current development notes:
(Current Date 11-9-2020)
I used some of Kendo UI components because the internet recommended using this 
because it is very good at creating charts, tables, etc. Which is good for a task manager/scheduler idea.


Here is how you download the needed Kendo UI packages:

First step-     ng add @progress/kendo-angular-scheduler

Second step-     ng add @progress/kendo-angular-dateinputs
